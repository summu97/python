Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python that allows Python developers to interact with Amazon Web Services (AWS) services. It simplifies tasks like creating, configuring, and managing AWS services and resources programmatically.

Installing boto3: pip install boto3
Install the AWS CLI: pip install awscli
Set up your credentials with the following command: aws configure

This will store your credentials in a configuration file (typically located in ~/.aws/credentials), which Boto3 will use to authenticate your requests.

Basic Example: Code to Start and Stop AWS EC2 Instances

import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

# Initialize EC2 client
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='us-west-2')  # Change region as per your setup

def start_instance(instance_id):
    try:
        # Start the EC2 instance
        response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
        print(f"Starting instance: {instance_id}")
        print(response)
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error occurred while starting instance: {e}")

def stop_instance(instance_id):
    try:
        # Stop the EC2 instance
        response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
        print(f"Stopping instance: {instance_id}")
        print(response)
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error occurred while stopping instance: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Replace with your EC2 instance ID
    instance_id = 'i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'

    # Start the instance
    start_instance(instance_id)

    # Stop the instance
    # stop_instance(instance_id)
