Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python that allows Python developers to interact with Amazon Web Services (AWS) services. It simplifies tasks like creating, configuring, and managing AWS services and resources programmatically.

Installing boto3: pip install boto3
Install the AWS CLI: pip install awscli
Set up your credentials with the following command: aws configure

This will store your credentials in a configuration file (typically located in ~/.aws/credentials), which Boto3 will use to authenticate your requests.

Basic Example: Listing S3 Buckets

import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon S3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# List all buckets
response = s3.list_buckets()

# Print bucket names
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(f'Bucket Name: {bucket["Name"]}')
